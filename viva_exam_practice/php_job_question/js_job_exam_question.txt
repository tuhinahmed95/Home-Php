10. Explain call(), apply(), and bind() methods.
Ans : call(): Invokes a function with a specified this and arguments provided individually.
     apply(): Similar to call(), but accepts arguments as an array.
      bind(): Creates a new function with a specified this context and pre-defined arguments.

11. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code?
Ans : Synchronous code is executed line by line, blocking further execution until the current task completes.
      Asynchronous code allows tasks to run in the background, freeing up the program to execute other tasks.
